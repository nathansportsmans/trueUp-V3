                Use the JSON converter to convert CSV files into legitimate JSON files for the True Up program to read. **All columns that have commas in the
                data need to be deleted.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Then:</strong><br>
                Use the True Up app to compare the two. Navigate to Home and then choose from the DropDown menu which account you are wanting to audit. 
                MAKE SURE THE FIRST FILE IS THE EMPLOYEE LIST AND THE SECOND FILE IS THE ACCOUNT LIST. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Future Versions will be easier to use. <br>
